# Cedille web track

This is the repository for the Cedille web track. This track is intended to be a
self-paced introduction to web development using frameworks and practices mostly
used our Club.

The track is divided into 3 modules :

- Module 0: Track Git

This module is intended to be a quick introduction to Git and GitHub. It is
intended to be a prerequisite for the rest of the track.

- Module 1: Track Hugo

This module is intended to be an introduction to Hugo, a static site generator.

- Module 2: Track Grav

This module is intended to be an introduction to Grav, a modern flat-file CMS.

You can start the track by following the instructions in the README of the first
module (Git). Then you can choose from one of the other two modules as you see
fit.
